    Was John really a time traveler, or was it just a hoax?

  <p>
    A person by the name “John Titor” appeared on the internet one day claiming that he was a time traveler from 2036.  The posts started in 2000 on the “Time Travel Institute” forums and many other bulletin boards.  He then proceeds to predict future events; some vague and some specific.  He then disappeared never to be heard of again.
    <br></br>
  Going by the screen names “TimeTravel_0” and “John Titor” on many different bulletin boards, he stated that he came from the year 2036 as a soldier from UNIX.  He stated that in this year, a computer virus would wipe the world.  His mission was to go to 1975 in order to take an IBM 5100 computer and only stopping in 2000 for personal reasons such as family.  He said that the IBM 5100 had a secret capability to emulate programs in both BASIC for system/3 and APL for system/370. (the “system” in this case refers to IBM mainframes)
  “We need the system to “debug” various legacy computer programs in 2036. UNIX has a problem in 2038.”  Was a statement from Titor on one of the forums.
  <br></br>
  When he first started posting on the forum he stated  “I don’t want you to believe me.”  and continues to answer the many questions that flooded him.  The many of his predictions included:
  <ul>
    <li>
      “A World War in 2015 killed nearly 3 billion people”
    </li>
    <br></br>
    <li>
      “None of the things I have said will be a surprise. They were set in motion ten, twenty, even thirty years ago. Are you really surprised to find out that Iraq has nukes now or is that just BS to whip everyone up into accepting the next war?”
    </li>
  <br></br>
    <li>
      “As a result of the many conflicts, no, there were no official Olympics after 2004.”
    </li>
  <br></br>
    <li>
      “Russia and China have always had a very strange relationship. Even the news I see now indicates that continued weapons deals to allies, border clashes and overpopulation will lead to hostilities. The West will become very unstable which gives China the confidence to “expand.””  “I believe they [China] are pretty close to putting a man in orbit. It should not surprise you if they do that soon.”
    </li>
  <br></br>
    <li>
      "The President or ‘leader’ in 2005 I believe tried desperately to be the next Lincoln and hold the country together but many of their policies drove a larger wedge into the Bill of Rights. The President in 2009 was interested only in keeping his/her power base."
    </li>
  <br></br>
    <li>
      "Time travel was invented in 2034. Off shoots of certain successful fusion reactor research allowed scientists at CERN to produce the world’s first contained singularity engine"
  "The basic design involves rotating singularities inside a magnetic field. By altering the speed and direction of rotation you can travel both forward and backward in time.”
    </li>
  </ul>
  Considering the authenticity of these statements, John Titor explains that the “Many Worlds Theory” was real.  This theory was created by Young Hugh Everett who disagreed on the measurements of quantum objects in relation to Niels Bohr’s “Quantum Theory”.  To Everett, a measurement of a quantum object causes an actual split in the universe resulting in an entirely duplicate universe.  Some might know this as parallel universes.  What Titor explained was that when he went back to the past and divulged information, it may have caused the universe to split or diverge into an alternate universe different than his own.  His presence caused our world to become another.   Ultimately saying that his predictions may or may not come true - very specific predictions turning vague.  To clarify, if the “Many Worlds Theory” is correct then there are many and many more different worlds.  If you are ever found in a situation where there are two different choices - then the universe splits.  Eg: When in one world you take a left, in that alternate universe you take a right.
  <br></br>
  Firstly, in relation to his original reason for travelling back to the past; the IBM 5100.  It was indeed true that the IBM 5100 was made in 1975 and its hidden functions was proved authentic.  According to Bob Dubke; one of the IBM 5100 engineers, it was hidden because they were scared of how their competition would use it.  Back in 2000, when most computer systems were pretty rare; even it this information was revealed, most individuals still wouldn’t have known.  But how did the figure “John Titor” know?  The most plausible explanation would be that he was also a working engineer of the IBM 5100, however another would be that he got the information from the future.  
  <br></br>
  Concerning UNIX from John Titor’s story, this is a very real company and also has a problem in relation to John Titor’s statement of 2036.  Unix was created in the 1970s in one of Bell’s labs made exclusively for programmers.  The problem for UNIX based computers was that it had a timeout.  The way they count time was not by years, months or days, but by seconds.  The problem is that there is a limit to how high they can count.  In particular to 32-bit integer UNIX based computers, starting on 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970; their limit was at 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, January 19, 2038.  They will then encounter something called 32-bit overflow making all the dates on the machine go back to 1901.  This will cause operating systems and certain software to malfunction.  In correlation to Titor’s statement “We need the system to “debug” various legacy computer programs in 2036. UNIX has a problem in 2038.” this “fact” from him contains many truths which question if he really is a hoax.
  <br></br>
  Conversely, his statement “A World War in 2015 killed nearly 3 billion people” and “As a result of the many conflicts, no, there were no official Olympics after 2004.”  were undoubtedly wrong.  
  <br></br>
  Looking at our current time which is inadvertently 2015, the possibility of having a world war 3 are pretty low - after the first two world wars, humanity has been more inclined for peace instead of violence.  This includes G8 which is an alliance of world powers.  However there may be a disconnect, supposedly, Russia has been planning for a 10 year war beginning in 2003 using nuclear devices.  Also, the Olympics after 2004 DID happen, this statement; without a question, was wrong.  Regarding the possibility of it actually happening considering John Titors statement towards the “Multiple Worlds” theory; maybe.  They did have Civil unrest about human rights in China, as well as announcements of boycotting the games however the games did not stop.
  <br></br>
  His other statements such as 2, 4, 5, and 6 held a little truth in it. Firstly, Iraq had been researching nuclear weapons since long ago, even before 2000 so it isn’t really a surprise.  Secondly, in the present time, we already know of the relationship and the semi cold war going on with ourselves and Russia/China however considering this in the viewpoint of someone of the year 2000 - knowing this would be considered odd.  Thirdly, the president who followed Lincoln’s examples would probably be Obama however Obama wasn’t the president in 2005.  Perhaps these statements were pushed back a few years, or the predictions couldn’t be so precisely pinpointed.  And finally, CERN is indeed a real group of scientists studying in the laws of Nuclear Research.  This includes instruments similar described by Titor however, this group was founded in 1954 which discredits John Titor who was in the year 2000.  
  <br></br>
  In conclusion, the plausibility of John Titor being a actual time traveller is at....a deathly 1.5/5.
  If you haven’t noticed, all the organizations that Titor talked about dated all the way back to 1950-1970.  Sure this gave him credibility as the organizations were actually real however this also says that throughout the 36 years that spanned, there will be no new organizations - particularly specific organizations concerning time travel.  This is highly unlikely.  Also, in many of John Titor’s statements of time travel; although he spoke of particle accelerators and detectors, he hadn’t once spoke of cell phones turning touch screen or the multiple uses we have of LED, which wasn’t introduced in 2000.  And, concerning his statements, they felt very authentic.  The elements of truth caused many to believe it however, most of which could be predicted.  There were alarming factors such as the president following Lincoln's footsteps or the matter with the IBM 5100 however Lincoln had always been a role model to most and since he was also a president, it isn’t surprising to find at least one president following his examples.  Also with the IBM 5100, even though it was contained as a secret, there are many ways that information could somehow leak, and since it was made in 1975 it a real possibility.
  <br></br>
  In the end, John Titor was NOT a time traveler however we can conclude that he was a very intellectual personnage who knew what was going on in the world.
